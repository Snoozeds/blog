Hi, I'm Valerie, also known as Snoozeds. I live in England, United Kingdom.
I'm mainly a developer that likes working on modding games, but recently I've shifted towards making both software for such purposes, but also working on my own game, which has caused me to take up an interest in 3D modeling, texturing, and also UI design.

You can find more information about me, my socials, and other projects I've worked on over at my [website](https://snoozeds.com).

This blog's main purpose it to just write down interesting things I encounter with my journey into game development and other hobbies. If that interests you, then welcome.
